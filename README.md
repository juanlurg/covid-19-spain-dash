# COVID-19 status in Spain
Exploring coronavirus pandemic data in Spain territory. 

#### Project Status: [On Hold]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to give clarity to the bunch of data we are exposed daily in this pandemic situation. 

To reach this goal we will first create an interactive dashboard to see live status daily by community. Appart from that some relevant indicators will be plotted to monitorize historical information. The second step will be to use machine learning and deep learning to model our data in order to predict the evolution of the pandemic. 

Step-by-step project building will be explained in the form of blog articles in my personal website. For more information please check the [Project Proposal](https://github.com/juanlurg/covid-19-spain-dash/blob/master/docs/proposal.pdf)

## Project Description
We will be building our project based in [datadista COVID 19 Spain data repository](https://github.com/datadista/datasets/tree/master/COVID%2019) and for map visualization we will need GeoJSON data of Spain found in [this repository](https://github.com/deldersveld/topojson/blob/master/countries/spain/spain-comunidad-with-canary-islands.json).

The roadmap of the project is going to be:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Web dashboard developing
3. Feature Engineering and dimensionality reduction if needed.
4. Modeling
5. Evaluation, parameter tunning.
6. Deployment.
